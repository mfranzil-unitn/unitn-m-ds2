Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log.
It is an efficient, understandable algorithm that is easier to implement than protocols such as Paxos, and offers equivalent performance and guarantees.
In this paper, we describe the implementation of a simulator of Raft using the Java language and Akka actor toolkit.
Our simulator comprises a Graphical User Interface, which provides a real-time view of the state of the servers in the cluster, allows the user to crash and resume the servers and submit new commands to be replicated.
% Our results show that the Raft protocol behaved correctly under the paper's assumption, while resulting scalable and easy to manage with the provided GUI.
% Andrea: Questa cosa sopra è ovvia; dato che il protocollo è formalmente verificato allora non vi è dubbio che funzioni
% TODO:
% The strength of the simulator is to enable the user to learn and appreciate the Raft protocol...
