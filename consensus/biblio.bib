abstract = {The consensus problem involves an asynchronous system of processes, some of which
may be unreliable. The problem is for the reliable processes to agree on a binary
value. We show that every protocol for this problem has the possibility of nontermination,
even with only one faulty process. By way of contrast, solutions are known for the
synchronous case, the "Byzantine Generals" problem.}

abstract="This paper addresses the Consensus problem in asynchronous distributed systems (made of n processes, at most f of them may crash) equipped with unreliable failure detectors. A generic Consensus proto- col is presented: it is quorum-based and works with any failure detector belonging to the class S (provided that f ≤ n -- or to the class ◊S (provided that f < n/2). This quorum-based generic approach for solv- ing the Consensus problem is new (to our knowledge). Moreover, the proposed protocol is conceptually simple, allows early decision and uses messages shorter than previous solutions.",

abstract = {We determine what information about failures is necessary and sufficient to solve
Consensus in asynchronous distributed systems subject to crash failures. In Chandra
and Toueg [1996], it is shown that W, a failure detector that provides surprisingly
little information about which processes have crashed, is sufficient to solve Consensus
in asynchronous systems with a majority of correct processes. In this paper, we prove
that to solve Consensus, any failure detector has to provide at least as much information
as W. Thus, W is indeed the weakest failure detector for solving Consensus in asynchronous
systems with a majority of correct processes.},
